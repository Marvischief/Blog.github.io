          <img src="img/pexels-alan-cabello-1278620.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Ask a thousand people to kill a lion, and you'll get no takers. But
            offer a prize, and suddenly everyone's a lion killer. Why? Because
            humans are wired to seek rewards. We see a prize, and our brains
            convince us that we can do anything. We're willing to put ourselves
            in danger, just for a chance at a reward. We are willing to open
            ourselves up to vulnerability, but only if there is something in it
            for us. Yet, this same vulnerability that is the root of shame,
            insecurity, and setbacks is also the birthplace of joy, creativity,
            love, life, and a sense of belonging and worthiness. How much more
            do we need to see before we are willing to embrace vulnerability for
            all that it is?
          </p>
          <h4>
            We live in a vulnerable world but numb vulnerability - “Brené Brown”
          </h4>
          <p>
            We humans try to numb our vulnerability, but it's like trying to
            hold back the tide, This is a defence mechanism that we develop from
            a young age, when we learn that being vulnerable can make us feel
            exposed and weak. From the moment we're born, our alter-egos have
            taught us that vulnerability is weakness. From our personal lives to
            our professional careers, we all have moments where we are humbled
            by our experiences. These moments can be good or bad, and they can
            happen in any area of our lives, such as our relationships, our
            businesses, or our health. When we experience humility, it is often
            because we have been reminded of our limitations. We may have made a
            mistake, or we may have been faced with a challenge that we cannot
            overcome on our own. In these moments, we are forced to confront our
            own humanity and to admit that we are not perfect. However, humility
            can also be a positive experience. It can teach us to be more
            grateful for what we have, and it can make us more compassionate
            towards others. Sometimes, we are confronted with our own
            limitations in a way that forces us to humble ourselves. This can
            happen when we are sick, when we fail at something, or when we are
            simply faced with a situation that is beyond our control. We're all
            goal-getters, but even the best of us need to be humbled sometimes.
            Those moments are a reminder that we're human, and that's what makes
            life beautiful.

              <strong
                >We humans are hardwired to seek certainty in an uncertain world
                :</strong>
              <p>
                We do this by creating belief systems, such as religion and
                politics, that give us a sense of order and meaning. <br />
                <b>Religion</b>
                has traditionally been a source of comfort and guidance for
                people, offering a framework for understanding the mysteries of
                life and death. However, in recent years, religion has become
                increasingly politicised, with different groups using it to
                justify their own beliefs and agendas. <br />
                <b>Politics,</b> too, has become a forum for conflict and
                division. In the past, politicians were more likely to focus on
                finding common ground and working together to solve problems.
                Today, however, political discourse is often characterised by
                name-calling, finger-pointing, and blame-shifting. <br />
                This trend towards certainty and division is a reflection of our
                own inner vulnerability. When we feel uncertain or threatened,
                we are more likely to cling to our beliefs and lash out at those
                who disagree with us. We need to find ways to embrace
                uncertainty and complexity, rather than trying to control them.
                We need to learn to listen to each other and find common ground,
                even when we disagree. And we need to find ways to express our
                pain and discomfort in a healthy way, rather than using it as an
                excuse to hurt others.

              <strong>We Perfect:</strong>
              <img src="img/pexels-pixabay-40721.jpg" alt="" />
              <p>
                I'm the kind of person who wants their life to be perfect. I
                mean, who doesn't? But it doesn't work! I mean, we literally
                take fat from our bums and put it in our cheeks! I hope in a
                hundred years people will look back and say, "Wow, those people
                were crazy! What were they thinking?" But then again, maybe I'm
                the crazy one. Maybe in a hundred years, everyone will be taking
                fat from their bums and putting it in their cheeks. Who knows?
                <br />
                But for now, I'm just going to keep being me. I'm going to keep
                striving for perfection, even though I know it's impossible. And
                I'm going to keep laughing at myself, even when I make mistakes.
                Because at the end of the day, that's all we can do. We can just
                keep trying our best, and hope for the best. We live in a world
                where there is no such thing as perfection. We are all flawed,
                in our own way.

              <strong>We Pretend:</strong>
              <img src="img/pexels-monstera-7114752.jpg" alt="" />
              <p>
                We're so afraid of being judged, we've become like those crabs
                in a bucket, we walk around with our hearts in our pockets,
                hoping no one will notice. We act like our habits and actions
                don't affect anyone else, like our decisions don't matter. But
                the truth is, we're all connected. Everything we do has an
                impact, whether we see it or not. We see someone trying to climb
                out, and we pull them back down. We're so afraid of being left
                behind, we'd rather keep everyone else down with us. But what if
                we stopped judging each other so much? What if we started
                lifting each other up instead? what if we let those walls down?
                What if we let ourselves be seen, flaws and all? What if we
                lived our lives with courage and vulnerability? Why don't we
                love and live with our whole hearts, even though there's no
                guarantee of reward? Why don't we practice gratitude and joy,
                and believe that we are enough? What if we realised that we're
                all in this together? <br />
                It would be scary, sure. It's scary to be vulnerable. It's scary
                to put yourself out there and risk getting hurt. But it's also
                the only way to truly live. it would also be amazing. We would
                finally be free to be ourselves, without fear of judgment. We
                would connect with others on a deeper level. We would experience
                the full range of human emotions, from joy to sorrow, from love
                to loss.

            we fill our stomachs with beer and live lazy, lonely lives. we’re
